     A Buffered window class.

     To use it, subclass it and define a Draw(DC) method that takes a DC
     to draw to. In that method, put the code needed to draw the picture
     you want. The window will automatically be double buffered, and the
     screen will be automatically updated when a Paint event is received.

     When the drawing needs to change, you app needs to call the
     UpdateDrawing() method. Since the drawing is stored in a bitmap, you
     can also save the drawing to file by calling the
     SaveToFile(self, file_name, file_type) method.
